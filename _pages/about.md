I'm Xujia Liu, currently a visiting student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
<br>
I have been admitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and will be transferring there in Fall 2026/Spring 2027 to pursue my B.S. in Computer Science.
<br>
Previously, I studied at the University of Nottingham China with Full Scholarship.
<br><br>
My research interests lie in HCI, Accessibility, VR, AI.
During the summer of 2025, I joined the HCI+ Lab through the HCI+ program (selected from ~100 out of 550 applicants), supervised by Dr. Yue Li, where I explored emotion detection in VR co-experiences using physiological signals.
<br><br>
I firmly believe that technology should always serve people.
<br>
And my ultimate goal is to create an accessible world where everyone,
regardless of their abilities, can equally benefit from technological innovations.
<br>
If you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to take 2 minutes to read my [blog](/blog/).
